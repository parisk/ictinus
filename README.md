Ictinus is a set of tools for architecting layouts in HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

## Principles

### Prefer CSS over JavaScript

Ictinus leaves the most decisions possible to CSS. Whatever cannot be accomplished by CSS, is being delegated to JavaScript (e.g. resizing an element with drag n drop). Essentially Ictinus employes the [rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power).
